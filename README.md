Millennium is an **open-source low-code modding framework** to create, manage and use themes/plugins for the desktop Steam Client without any low-level internal interaction or overhead.

If you enjoy this tool, please consider starring the project ‚≠ê


## Installation

### Automatic Installation (Recommended)

Installing Millennium is only a few steps. See [this page](https://docs.steambrew.app/users/installing) for a more detailed guide.

### Manual Installation

For normal users, installing via the installers makes the most sense. However when wanting to either develop Millennium, or when the installers do not work, this option can be used. Check our [documentation](https://docs.steambrew.app/users/installing#manual) for a guide on how to do this.

&nbsp;

## Official Plugin Repository

Millennium is designed to be fully extensible through plugins.  
To ensure version compatibility and safety, we maintain a separate, curated [PluginDatabase](https://github.com/SteamClientHomebrew/PluginDatabase) repository.  

All plugins in the PluginDatabase are versioned and reviewed to work seamlessly with the current Millennium release, reducing the risk of conflicts or instability when adding new features.

**For more related information, checkout the [plugin database](https://github.com/SteamClientHomebrew/PluginDatabase)**.


## Adding Spoken Language Support

Take a look [here](./assets#adding-languages), it quickly covers what files you'll need to edit in order to add your spoken language to Millennium!


## Creating Plugins & Themes

Creating themes and plugins for Millennium is relatively straight foward. Our [documentation](https://docs.steambrew.app/developers) goes over the basics of both,
and we have examples for both in [examples](./examples)


## Platform Support

Supported Platforms:

-   Windows (x86/x64/ARM) NT (10 and newer)
